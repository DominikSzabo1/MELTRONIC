<img src="./data/MELTRONIC_schematic.png" width="900">

### Required packages
```r
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(argparser)
library(stringr)
```

### Available command line applications:
- matrix_wide_to_long.R:   
    Converts a square matrix into a long matrix for IS calculation. Accepts wildcards for processing of multiple chromosomes.
- long_matrix_to_IS.R:   
    Calculates insulation scores at multiple distances (default 100kb - 1Mb, steps of 100kb).
- MELTRONIC.R:   
   Compares insulation score (IS) distributions over regions of interest. Was applied to 120 kb sliding windows accross the entire genome and and long genes for the preparation of the manuscript.    
    
type
```bash
Rscript command_line_apps/matrix_wide_to_long.R --help 
```
for explanations

### Available Snakefiles:
- Snakefile_wide_to_melt_long_genes:   
   Example Snakefile for calculation of melting scores of long protein coding genes (> 200 kb). Includes reshaping of square NPMI matrices to long NPMI matrices, ultra-fast calculation of insulation scores using 10 square sizes, and calculation of melting scores.
- Snakefile_wide_to_MELTRONIC:   
   Example Snakefile for calculation of melting scores in 120 kb sliding windows across the entire mouse genome (autosomes + chrX):. Includes reshaping of square NPMI matrices to long NPMI matrices, ultra-fast calculation of insulation scores using 10 square sizes, and calculation of melting scores.
